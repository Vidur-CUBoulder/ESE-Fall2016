Part1 : DMA Operation and Profiling 
The DMA feature allows the RAM to gain access to the memory without CPU intervention. This is a significantly faster method of accessing memory and is especially notable for large trasnfer chunks. The DMA operation was successfully created on the Freescale Freedom board and subsequently profiled.
